# Color

- use color attribute on button to set the color equal to the ones you have in your default palette theme.
- Check out the MuiButton.tsx to see a nice looking version of them
- We used the Stack component as well to show these nicely on the page. Very similar to flexbox, really cool. Give it a look.
