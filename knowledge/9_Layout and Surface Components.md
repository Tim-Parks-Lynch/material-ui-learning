# Layout and Surface components

- These components have to deal with layout or the surface look of your applications

# Box component

- serves as a wrapper component for most of your css utility needs
- mostly used as a css utility component
- in it's most basic form it is used as a replacement for the div tag
  - it will show as a div in your html
  - you can change the component prop for semantic html
  - use this when you need to access the primary theme as it allows access to the sx prop which not all components have
  - can use the system props from mui system with it (look this up later it is a whole other library)
